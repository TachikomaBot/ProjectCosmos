# Matter
Repo for the game Codenamed Project Cosmos. Currently in the design and planning phase.

## The Pitch
Chased to the furthest reaches of known space you and your companions discover an ancient alien device with the potential to reshape the galaxy. Rebuild and repopulate a colossal artificial installation, construct an unbeatable armada to destroy your enemies, and bed some beauties to boot! The power is there for the taking, and _with great power comes great pleasure_.

## Funding
Start on Patreon to develop a fanbase and source of income which can fund a detailed prototype that features all core gameplay systems and looks good. With that built, we can transition away from Patreon to Kickstarter, in order to generate the capital necessary to make the leap from the prototype to a full-fledged game.

## Why shift from Patreon to Kickstarter?

It is a common perception in game funding communities that using Patreon tends to cause development to drag on for longer than necessary since devs are making money without having to release the full game. The Patreon will give us the time to build a passionate community, and confidence that a Kickstarter campaign will be successful. Shifting from Patreon to Kickstarter once the vertical slice is complete and released is a signal to supporters of the game that we, the devs, are serious about development and finishing what we started.

## Why make this game with adult features?

The short answer? Because I think there exists an unfilled niche in the current market of games for high-quality, complex and entertaining games that also have detailed sex systems. Both types of games exist apart from each other, but there haven't been any notable games that attempt to do both (except possibly Subverse, a game yet to be released). Many AAA games heavily feature sexually explicit imagery and content but fail to let the player engage in that sexualized world through gameplay (cough cough Cyberpunk 2077). This game is an attempt to bridge the gap - to provide engaging gameplay and complex systems to explore and master that build towards short but pleasurable sexual experiences before returning to the core game systems.

## Plot Synopsis
You and your companions, chased to the far ends of the galaxy and on your last legs, stumble upon an ancient artifact. It is an artificial wormhole that allows for the exploration of a dwarf galaxy that is unexplored. You must rebuild the Orbital station that manages the artificial wormhole to keep your control over it from galactic factions that would try to take it from you. As you go about building and managing the orbital, exploring new lands, and engaging in space battles, you will develop your character, their governing style, and their relationships with other characters, sexual or otherwise.

## Gameplay Prototype
The gameplay prototype is a vertical slice of the game that features small, representative portions of the core gameplay systems using very simple art. Alterations necessary for the vertical slice will be noted in each relevant section.

The vertical slice will consist of the gameâ€™s prologue and first act, finding, activating and taking control of the artifact. 

This will first involve a tutorial of the fleet combat system, which will require taking over the Solar system the artifact is in. The player then plays through a tutorial that introduces them to the basic city building mechanics, the research trees and the character progression paths. 

The player will finally be given a simple goal consisting of getting the first Plate on the Orbital up and running by building Districts and accumulating a sufficient quantity of resources, income flow, and fleet power.
